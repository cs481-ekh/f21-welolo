## Abstract
Welolo is a platform for local businesses that allows their customers to pay it forward. It allows for gifting products and services to friends, family, and strangers to draw new customers and increase business. In its current state, a user is able to pay with a credit or debit card using Square to pay it forward. However, in the interest of ease of use for the user, Welolo is looking to expand their payment options and implement a system to notify those who have been gifted money. For this project, we created a checkout process in a sandboxed environment using Gravity and implemented Twilio to text the recipient once a product or service has been gifted to them.
